In the usual case, local host is used to refer to “this computer”. Using Sync Thing, one can share folders across multiple devices. That treats those specific folders as a local folder, and you can run a local host port using the same port across two devices, because it acts as two separate ported hosts. The existing HTML file is already able to be accessed across the different devices as long as they have been properly sync with. When you boot up port 8000 on each device, you can view the same page with the same port. So even though you use the same file, it acts as two separate servers.

In most cases, this works perfectly fine for networking HTML files off line. However you run into trouble when trying to set up Gitea. Unless you specifically set the Gits to the same folder on both devices, you have to have two different Git directories. The shared file system doesn’t carry over to user-accounts. Even in the case where one may be able to use the same Git folder, it would be those folders accessed through two separate accounts. The long story short, you cannot share the account across multiple devices, unless you tunnel the website. Even then this is impractical if you don’t have a permanent sub domain. When means having to use one computer as a the host, tunnel that into public access.

LT had a specific problem with giving users a consistent sub domain. If you accidentally shut down the tunneler incorrectly, then you start getting random sub domain replacements. Which means setting up a completely different port. So for me, the foreseeable future looks like one where I will only be able to use local host on each machine, and deal with accessing the same shared git file system across multiple laptops. One of the laptops is over five years old, and the newer one is barely younger than that. So I’m not sure how much longer the laptops will last, and so far it seems like tech companies are trying to shove tablets and smart phones in our faces.

I used to call myself something of an artificial intelligence developer, although my hanging out with one chat room on this one weak cryptographic chat room sapped a lot of the energy that I had. Now I’m something akin to a wandering poet, curious as to whether I will ever again regain inspiration to build strong human like AI. It’s not like writing, where it entirely a part of who I am. I learned Ruby programming largely because I had to, learning the difference between strings, variables, methods, classes, and using string substitution to insert values on the terminal.

At points, my own disinterest in the flow of lime green matrix strings felt terminal, lost in a wave of increasingly outdated Graphical User interfaces. Floating in an imaginary abyss of trashed dot matrix printers at the bottom of the river of Chattanooga, Slowly coming up for air, with my long curly brown hair.

A programmer out of time.

Only variables on a screen of fading sickness.
