Sometimes it’s easy to forget how differently your parents raised you to think they were, and the sudden realizations you get when you get to know them more as you get older. As a case in point, the conclusions you hear from their mouth, and how your personality grows over time to be different from them. As much as they try to tell you you will end up just like them, despite all evidence to the contrary, the reality is that they will tell you this regardless of how similar you are to them. This is why it is so important to remember to focus on improving yourself.

The rain drops from the simulated environment sounded almost like actual rain, with the only difference being that one doesn’t actually get wet from the atmosphere.

Recently I had to completely reinstall my operating system, because my computer was constantly overheating. The website that I used to write at was also breached, although so far as I could tell I was experiencing no others from that. Although it is reminder that I should probably focus on building my own websites. I already mostly host my stuff over on Github or Glitch, although generally only in iframe format these days. With the main website actually hosted over the interplanetary file system protocol. Recently I haven’t had as much time to do the things I want to do, although I certainly had enough time to do some of the things I wanted to. Mostly getting more art done.

I mostly draw traditionally, despite the common suggestion to do the opposite. But consider that the tablet that I use doesn’t even have a screen, and generally this would be harder to get used to. But what good drawing implement has you need to get used to it? It should just feel natural. For example, no matter how I hold it ( I’m left handed ) it should flow about as well as my motor control. And I can let my mind wander as smoothly as the storm in the simulated environment pours down rain. As gently as the sand merges with the sky in the desert.

I have an odd way of script writing, which is a lot of the reason I resolved to draw my own art, rather than try to convince someone else to draw for me. This doesn’t mean that I don’t have people trying to solicit a script from me. But I can’t help but have the feeling: why offer your services now? Even though the person offering the service is a different person from the guy I knew at the RPG Maker forms. I definitely have had a long history with that place, way to much to go into here. However needless to say, I’m not to fond of game design circles, and generally feel like they don’t nurture creativity all that to well. With most of their game titles basically following the same formula. By contrast, I always wrote my titles based on the final line in the story.

And yet in this story, I’m not even sure what title to give it. Other than the story of the way that I see the world. I view the world in a slightly different way, yes. Though I’m not going to blame that on me being autistic. Or that I’m a trans woman. I would rather be acknowledged on my own terms, without social persuasion. I sometimes find myself justifying the things that I feel, despite it being perfectly valid to have my own feelings about issues. Part of it was how I was raised, constantly seeking approval from my parents. Although if I told the world that they would twist my words and say I was making excuses. I now no longer have much of an interest in science fiction, despite reading bucket loads. It simply doesn’t ignite the same levels of spark that it used to. Lets just say that I prefer to see the world as it actually is, how I actually perceive it.

Sometimes this might not be to people’s liking. But I tell my own story on my own terms, rather than how others choose to accept it. It was a lot of the reason I left that writing website a long time ago. As distant a memory as that was, I would rather work preventably than try to get people to comment constructively. So often people on these website seek to tear other people down. Which is why I don’t entirely trust websites that seek that specific thing that I want. I just don’t have the time to comment on everything that I see slip through social media feeds, and recently had to mute a few people. Most of my life is spent indoors, and I don’t want to waste that time by looking at things that make me angry on the INTERNET. I already spent way to much time trying to find times to write, back when I was living with my toxic room mate. Who thought mainly of herself. And told me that nobody owed me shit. Well, to be literal, I never asked for shit. I also didn’t ask for her mouth.

But at least with that website gone, I can mostly focus on my own thoughts, as I listen to the rain drop slowly upon the simulated pavement, and let myself journal away inside of my thoughts.

Life can be a microphone.

Sometimes you got to eat it.


The current climate in the comic industry certainly has me stressed, although what stresses me out is less the economic state, as web comic creators generally never had much of a dog in that race to begin with. What is more distressing is how political the portion of the American comic book audience makes the topic, who ironically at times claim to not be political. But the mainstream people in comics also come across just as bad. And even independent comics people have just as much of a problem. There is this one guy that apparently has a disability, and that’s how he markets himself. I wouldn’t go so far as to say he is marketing himself cynically, but it’s an interesting coping mechanism for some to try to stick it to the right-wing establishment.

My general perception of the American comic industry, and something akin to a perpetual war between independent comic creators and mainstream creators, with the actual difference between such creations becoming increasingly blurry over time. At least with manga it has pretty much always had several different genres. But DC and Marvel have a way of making themselves look like they are the entirety of the comics industry. Even though there are more viable directions one could go. For myself, I intend to mostly focus on web syndication, now that I can make my own website with out having to worry about either content guidelines or rude comments on the net. Comments is not something I generally have to worry about anyway, as I’m only here to please myself.

Comic sate gets this idea that you’re there to produce something akin to pulp fiction. Which makes one wonder how they feel about people who write autobiographical content. This is why to much the real between is not between left-wing and right-wing factions in comics, but rather between legacy and the new breed of comics creators coming out with radically different visions of what could be considered good. And I didn’t start trying to do my own comics by conforming to other people’s standards of what is good. I started my own stuff to conform to my own sets of standards. My own voice, my own values. My own life’s record plastered on the net.

For at the end of the day, I got to like my own work.

And I don’t like to read genre fiction. Sorry, but it’s true.

I managed to get around fifty four or so pages done of my graphic novel done, although there is still much left of it I need to do. Mostly just trying to see how far I can get with it, while slowly building up enough energy to begin writing “real” books again. With an itchy bottom distracting me, and an even itchier scalp, while I wait for the morning to come, so I can take a shower.

Wash away the daily worries.

Let things melt away.
