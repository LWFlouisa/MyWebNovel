Welcome to my current webnovel project. Note that this will be a slightly different writing style than you may be used to from me. I think I'm slowly moving away from science fiction. I don't think I'll move back to writing fantasy anytime soon, as I've always viewed fantasy just shy of historical fiction, therefore has the same issues I associate with it: there is a difference between a depressing future, and something set in the past that you can't change. With anything set in the future, there is this idea you can prevent it from happening. Not so with historical.

For this reason, this will be written largely in stream of conciousness fashion and without planning. For those who prefer more formulaic fiction, this blog may not be the one for you.
